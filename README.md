# Favorite Music of 2021

A site presenting my favorite albums, songs, and sounds of 2021.

My first go at Parcel and PostCSS-only (no SASS preprocessor).

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Development

This command starts a web server at `http://localhost:1234`, watches files, does asset compilation, etc.

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build

First, run the **Installation** steps above!

```sh
npm run build
```

This generates the site as a collection of static files into the `dist/` directory. After that I just SFTP everything up to my website because that's easy!
